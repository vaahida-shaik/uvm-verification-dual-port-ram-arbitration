UVM-based verification of a dual-port RAM with concurrent access, arbitration handling, and functional coverage-driven validation.
# 🚀 Advanced UVM Verification of True Dual-Port RAM with Conflict Resolution

**UVM-based verification of a dual-clock, conflict-resolving memory with constrained-random testing, functional coverage, and scoreboard-based validation.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the **verification of a True Dual-Port RAM (256 x 8)** using **SystemVerilog and UVM**.

The DUT supports:

* Simultaneous read/write operations on two independent ports
* Separate clock domains
* Priority-based arbitration with dynamic conflict resolution

A **complete UVM verification environment** was built to validate functionality, detect corner-case bugs, and ensure data integrity under concurrent operations.

## ❓ Why This Project?

Modern SoCs rely heavily on shared memory resources accessed by multiple masters.
Handling **concurrent access, arbitration, and data consistency** is critical.

This project demonstrates:

* Verification of concurrent hardware behavior
* Handling race conditions and write conflicts
* Validating multi-clock domain systems

## ⚙️ Design Specifications

* **Memory Size:** 256 x 8
* **Ports:** Dual (Port A & Port B)
* **Clock Domains:** Independent (clk_a, clk_b)
* **Arbitration Rule:**

  * Port A → Highest priority
  * Port B → Relocated to next free address on conflict
* **RTL:** Verilog (kept unchanged)
* **Verification:** SystemVerilog + UVM

## 🔍 Test Scenarios

### 🟢 Test 1 – Memory Initialization

* Verified all memory locations initialize to zero

### 🟢 Test 2 – Basic Read/Write

* Independent operations on both ports
* Verified correct data readback

### 🟢 Test 3 – Asynchronous Clock Operation

* Ports driven with different clock frequencies
* Verified independent operation

### 🔴 Test 4 – Conflict Arbitration

* Both ports write to same address
* Port A retains address
* Port B relocates to free location

### 🔴 Test 5 – Memory Full Condition

* Entire memory filled
* Verified behavior when no free space is available

### 🔴 Test 6 – Partial Memory Filling

* Pre-filled memory regions
* Verified correct relocation behavior

### 🟡 Test 7 – Burst Write → Read

* Multiple writes followed by reads
* Data integrity verified

### 🟡 Test 8 – Random Stress Testing

* Constrained random transactions
* High coverage achieved
